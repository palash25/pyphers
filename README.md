### Ciphers written in Python
This repository contains various substitution ciphers coded in Python.

The aim of this project is to learn both basic cipher algorithms and Python.

I will be documenting implementations of some of the ciphers on [GeeksForGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) in the form of technical articles as a part of my summer internship.

---
This repository contains the implementations of the following ciphers.
* Caeser Cipher - Read my article on its special case [ROT13](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rot13-cipher/)
* Atbash Cipher - Read my article on [Atbash Cipher](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-atbash-cipher/)
* Baconian Cipher - Read my article on [Baconian Cipher](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/baconian-cipher/)
* Morse Code Translator - Read my article on [Morse Code Translator In Python](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/morse-code-translator-python/)

The rest of the ciphers are still in pipeline. i love u palash
